Our app helps the busy parent track their baby's activities. The first month of the baby development is an exhausting period for those parents that are adjusting keeping track of their newborn daily schedule. The BabyLog app will help parents reminding/ tracking about feeding, sleeping time, vitamin supplement and diaper change time while visualizing the data via graphs.

Our goal is to provide an easy to understand user interface. Where the user is able to learn how to navigate the menus and screens fluidly. As a busy parent, we want the user to quickly record their baby's information. Then at the end of the day be able to see all the important details on the summary page and also view this information in graphs to better understand their baby's development.

We created a unique design using big fonts and buttons to help the busy parent navigate the system as easy as possible. One of our goals is to help the user be able to use our app in a one-handed motion and use shortcuts to quickly access the important features of the app. Keeping everything concise and easy to understand is what makes our app different from other apps in the market.

After the gradle is done syncing, connect the android device (if available) and click the play button on top tool bar. A pop up screen should show up and select where you would like to run the app. The app will download on the device selected and once the app is opened it will ask you to create an account or login through gmail or there is also a button to go right to the homescreen.
